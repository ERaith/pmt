## Pokemon Builder
This project is a pokemon builder! The app allows the user to choose which pokemon they want to have on their team and compare their defensive weaknesses to build a devistating team for competition. The user can sort the pokemon by name or type and save their chosen team for later.

### Learning Goals
- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components and asynchronous functionality.
- Utilize Redux for providing props from a unified prop store.
- Write full coverage tests for Redux actions and reducers.
